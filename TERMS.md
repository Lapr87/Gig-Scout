# Gig Scout: Terms of Service

Last Updated: February 2026

Welcome to **Gig Scout**. By using our platform, you agree to the following terms. We’ve kept them simple because we value your time as much as your neighborhood.

---

### 1. The Platform Fee (Our 10%)
To keep the lights on and the scouts scouting, Gig Scout automatically deducts a **10% platform fee** from the total budget of every task. 
* **Example:** If a Neighbor posts a $100 task, the Scout receives $90, and the platform retains $10.
* This fee is calculated and deducted automatically at the time of payment.

### 2. Payments & Security
All financial transactions are processed securely via **Stripe**. 
* Gig Scout does not store your credit card or bank account details on our servers.
* Payouts to Scouts are triggered once the Neighbor confirms the task is complete.

### 3. The "Keep it on Gig Scout" Rule
To protect our community and ensure everyone gets paid, all communication and payments must stay on the platform.
* Sharing phone numbers, emails, or personal payment handles (like Venmo or CashApp) in the chat is strictly prohibited.
* Our automated "Chat Bouncer" monitors for this and may flag or suspend accounts that attempt to move transactions off-platform.

### 4. Community Trust (Ratings)
Trust is our currency. 
* Both Neighbors and Scouts must rate each other (1-5 stars) after every task.
* Consistently low ratings or "no-shows" may result in removal from the platform.

### 5. Liability & Conduct
Gig Scout is a marketplace, not an employer. We provide the connection, but the "Scout" is responsible for the quality of the work, and the "Neighbor" is responsible for providing a safe environment. Gig Scout is not liable for any disputes, damages, or injuries that occur during a task.
